## 📊 **Weekly Summary Overview**

Every **Friday**, the system triggers an automated report that provides key insights into the week’s maintenance activities, including:

1. **Categorization of Issues by Frequency**  
   The system categorizes issues based on how often they occur. For example:  
   - “10 plumbing issues at Property X”
   - “5 electrical issues at Property Y”


2. **Comparison of Resolution Times**  
 The report identifies tasks with the highest and lowest resolution times, these details help property managers identify tasks requiring further review.

4. **Flagging Delayed Requests**  
   Any maintenance requests taking longer than a predefined threshold are flagged for further attention. This feature ensures accountability and timely resolution of critical issues.
